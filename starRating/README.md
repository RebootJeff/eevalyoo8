# Star Rating Component

Make a "Star Rating" component that allows users to click on stars to set a rating (akin to popular review ratings like Yelp).

1. If a Product Manager / Designer tasked you with creating this component, what questions would you ask to better understand the requirements?
2. Use [JS Complete Playground](https://jscomplete.com/playground) as a simple dev environment to implement the component. Feel free to use your own dev environment if you have one ready.
3. Verbally discuss your thought process and approach as you write code. Pretend you are teaching a junior engineer or intern who is watching you to learn.
4. Do whatever you would do "in real life". This means you can use Google, look up documentation, write pseudocode, write prototype code and refine it, etc.

To get started on JS Complete Playground, you can use the following boilerplate:

```javascript
const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return <HelloWorld />;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, mountNode);
```

## Bonus

1. Style the component to demonstrate your CSS skills.
2. Write or at least discuss possible tests.
